## Introduction


A project to simplify the discovering of maximum likelihood points by applying 
the  `erf` function.

## Project

Project developed in the course of Statistics-UFSM for the conclusion of the 
course. Based in a recent paper, Zea and Andrade (2021) proposed a new generator
of distributions called the erf-$G$ family. Their proposal provides special 
distributions without adding complexity to parametric spaces of resulting models.
Empirical evidences shows that the proposed family may solve issues of flat or 
quasi-red likelihoods in some baselines.Due to great applied potential of the 
new model, this package provides a computational implementation of the erf-$G$ 
family. The density, distribution and quantile functions,  besides functions to
generates the erf-$G$  random variables are implemented.
